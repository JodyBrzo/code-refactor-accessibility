## Why I made this site
Homework 1 Accessibility Webpage - Horiseon web services website was built to showcase web accessibility skills.  This site takes advantage of HTML5 semantic elements, alt image attributes and a page title to produce the best accessibility user experience.

## What I learned
I really learned a lot doing this project! Before I started I did not know what semantic elements were, how accessibility worked nor had even used any accessibility features before.  I now have a much better understanding of the tools available as well as what a user may experience that needs to use accessibility.  

Before I knew Chrome had a built-in screen reader extension, ChromeVox, I downloaded an opensource screen reader from NV Access called NVDA.  When using NVDA on this website it reads through the whole page, every header, image alt attribute and paragraph. You can also navigate around using the tab key to every item on the page and NVDA will read it.  

ChromeVox works a bit differently where tab only navigates the links and you must click the headings and paragraphs with your mouse in order to be read.  

Overall, I prefer NVDA for accessibility.  If you would like to try NVDA yourself you can download it here [NV Access NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/)

## Challenges 
One major challenge I faced and still want to fix in the future is the navigation links when the page resizes.  They should resize over the main image, instead they push the image down.  

This change happened when originally that image was coded in CSS as a background image of the div.  The homework required all images to have alt attributes so that meant the image needed to be pulled out of the CSS and into the HTML as an img tag.  I worked for hours trying to solve the resizing problem but could not seem to find the answer.  Check back for updates, I can't wait to tell you what the answer is!
